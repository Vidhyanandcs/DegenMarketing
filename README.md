A marketing strategy for bringing degens to Algorand

## Aim
Using your best practices, create a marketing strategy to bring Degen to Algorand. The marketing strategy should be targeted towards Degens (users that truly believe in crypto projects). To approach this bounty would be to imagine you have a budget for a marketing strategy for Algorand.

## SWOT Analysis
SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis is a framework used to evaluate a protocol's competitive position and to develop strategic planning. SWOT analysis assesses internal and external factors, as well as current and future potential. 

### Strength

1. **Technology**: The technological advantage of PPOS(Pure Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism with instant finality and reliability is always an attraction for end-users.

2. **Team**: The team working at the algorand foundation and Algorand inc pushing new tools and updates to the protocol increases the confidence in the community and Degens.

3. **Community**: An ever expanding community that is interested in blockchain technology and the future impact it can make to the ecosystem.

### Weakness

1. **Awareness**: More awareness about the defi and NFT ecosystem on algorand is a missing piece. This is quite evident from the interaction that i had with twitter degens.

2. **Developers**: Developers and creators in the ecosystem are predominantly from USA, Europe. We need more involvement from Asian and African region.

### Opportunities

1. **Institutional Interest**: Well known institutions like FIFA, Napster, Limewire and more have introduced their web3 products on algorand. This has certainly added interest among degens from other chains.

2. **Bridges**: More number of defi and NFT bridges from algorand to other chains will help to move assets to and fro from the chain which attract new users from other chains.

### Threat

1. **Regulation**: Regulations that not positive for defi and NFTs will adversely affect the ecosystem.

2. **Competition**: Other L1 protocols like ethereum and solana are also building new tech and have good price action during bull runs which attract more degens.


## Marketing Strategy

The marketing strategy is designed with the analysis that has been done above. The strengths and opportunities are used to overcome the weakness and threats posed.

1. **Collaborate with influencers from etherum space**: The Influencers from ETH can be brought in for collaborations especially in the NFT space where the NFTs are minted on ETH and utility will be provided on the Algorand blockchain. This will attract degens as it makes sense for the degens to utilize the lower cost and instant finality of algorand blockchain.

2. **Provide Soul Bound NFTs**: For cross conferences and events soul Bound NFts can be given which will act as an entry into an ecosystem or another perticular event. This can also act asa discount coupon in the real world. The utility will have great impact on the degens from the other ecosystem which can attract more people.

3. **Cross Chain NFTs/Tokens**: Create cross chain NFTs which will allow degens from other chain to interact with the ecosystem. Bridges to other chains is important in this case where we can move NFTs to and fro across chains. Even defi tokens can be moved this way to attract degens.

4 **Community Champions**: Appoint community champions who are active in the algorand community. We have to make sure that there is at-least one active community member in the top 30 countries and they remain active across the year.
They can go to local blockchain events meet degens and interact with them and spread awareness. They can also provide valuable feedback which can be used by the foundation to change the strategy as per changing need of the ecosystem in the country.
